<h1 align="center">Python SMB Server</h1>

## Description
This SMB server allows clients to connect and interact with shared resources using the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. It provides basic functionality to handle client connections, logins, and file sharing. 

## Requirements
-  Python 3.x
-  impacket library


```
pip3 install impacket
```
## Installation

-  **Go and download smb_server.py**


Replace 'ShareName' with the desired name for the shared folder and '/path/to/shared/folder' with the actual path to the directory you want to share.

## How it Works
The SMB server is implemented in Python using the impacket.smbserver.SimpleSMBServer class. It handles client connections, logins, and file sharing.
